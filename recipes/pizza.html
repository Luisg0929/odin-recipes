            <p>
                A pizza is a beloved Italian dish that has become popular worldwide. 
                It typically consists of a round, flattened base of dough topped with a 
                variety of ingredients, including tomato sauce, cheese (usually mozzarella),
                 meats (such as pepperoni, sausage, or ham), vegetables (such as mushrooms, 
                 onions, bell peppers, or olives), and herbs and spices (such as basil, oregano, 
                 or garlic). The pizza is then baked in an oven, resulting in a crispy crust, melted cheese, 
                 and flavors melded together. Pizza can be customized to suit individual tastes, ranging from 
                 traditional Margherita with just tomato, mozzarella, and basil to more adventurous 
                 combinations. It is often enjoyed as a casual meal or snack, either at home, in 
                 restaurants, or delivered piping hot from a pizzeria. With its versatility and universal 
                 appeal, pizza remains a comfort food favorite for many around the globe.

                <li>Dough</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Toppings</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the dough: Mix flour, yeast, water, salt, and a bit of olive oil together until a dough forms. Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic, then let it rise until doubled in size.</li>
                <li>Roll out the dough: Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into portions. Roll each portion out into a round shape, forming the pizza base.</li>
                <li>Add sauce and toppings: Spread tomato sauce evenly over the pizza base, leaving a small border around the edges. Sprinkle shredded mozzarella cheese on top, then add your desired toppings, such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, or any other ingredients you like.</li>
                <li>Bake the pizza: Preheat your oven to a high temperature, around 450°F (230°C) or higher. Carefully transfer the assembled pizza onto a preheated baking sheet or pizza stone. Bake the pizza in the preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and melted, typically around 10-15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy: Once the pizza is cooked to your liking, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly. Slice the pizza into wedges and serve hot. Enjoy your homemade pizza with your favorite beverages and sides!</li>
