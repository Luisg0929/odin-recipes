        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice combined with 
                various ingredients such as raw or cooked seafood, vegetables, and occasionally 
                tropical fruits, wrapped in seaweed (nori) or served as rolls (maki). It is often 
                accompanied by soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi. Sushi is renowned for its delicate 
                flavors, artful presentation, and emphasis on fresh, high-quality ingredients. It has 
                become popular worldwide, celebrated not only for its taste but also for its cultural 
                significance and the craftsmanship involved in its preparation.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rice</li>
                <li>Seaweed</li>
                <li>Salmon or Tuna</li>
                <li>Seasoning of choice</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the rice: Rinse short-grain sushi rice thoroughly until the water runs clear. Cook the rice according to package instructions or using a rice cooker. Once cooked, season the rice with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, gently folding it in to ensure each grain is coated. Let the seasoned rice cool to room temperature.</li>
                <li>Choose your ingredients: Select a variety of fresh ingredients such as seafood (e.g., salmon, tuna, shrimp), vegetables (e.g., cucumber, avocado, carrots), and other fillings (e.g., crab meat, tofu). Slice these ingredients into thin strips or pieces suitable for rolling.</li>
                <li>Prepare the workspace: Lay out a bamboo sushi rolling mat (makisu) on a clean surface. Place a sheet of nori (seaweed) shiny side down on the mat.</li>
                <li>Assemble the sushi: With damp hands, spread a thin layer of seasoned rice evenly over the nori, leaving about half an inch of space at the top. Arrange your chosen fillings in a line across the center of the rice.</li>
                <li>Roll the sushi: Using the bamboo mat, gently roll the nori and rice over the fillings, applying pressure to compact the ingredients into a tight cylinder. Once rolled, use a sharp knife to slice the sushi roll into individual pieces. Serve with soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi, and enjoy!</li>
