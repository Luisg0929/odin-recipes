                Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish consisting of vinegared rice combined with 
                various ingredients such as raw or cooked seafood, vegetables, and occasionally 
                tropical fruits, wrapped in seaweed (nori) or served as rolls (maki). It is often 
                accompanied by soy sauce, pickled ginger, and wasabi. Sushi is renowned for its delicate 
                flavors, artful presentation, and emphasis on fresh, high-quality ingredients. It has 
                become popular worldwide, celebrated not only for its taste but also for its cultural 
                significance and the craftsmanship involved in its preparation.
